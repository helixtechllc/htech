NOTE: Be sure you are using the same server version and distribution from the course for these topics.
Download the appropriate Java JDK version from the Oracle website. For this course, we use jdk-8u121.
Copy the package from your local environment to the target server.
Install and configure Java (jdk-8u121).
Install Jenkins (version 2.19.4).
Complete the Install Wizard.


1. Go to: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
2. Download the appropriate Java JDK version from the Oracle website. For this course, we use jdk-8u121.
3. Copy the package from your local environment to the target server.
    Below is an example using scp:
    scp jdk-8u121-linux-x64.rpm user@your-server:/home/user/
4. Install the jdk package.
    rpm -Uvh jdk-8u121-linux-x64.rpm
5. Set up alternatives for Java:
   $ alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/java/latest/bin/java 200000
   $ alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /usr/java/latest/bin/javac 200000
   $ alternatives --install /usr/bin/jar jar /usr/java/latest/bin/jar 200000
  Note: Check out Terry’s nugget on this for more detail: “Setting Local and Global Java Environment Variables”
6. Set JAVA_HOME environmental variable in rc.local.
  vi /etc/rc.local
  export JAVA_HOME=”/usr/java/latest”
  Jenkins Install

#Add the Jenkins repo to your yum sources on the CentOS node.
  wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
Import the Jenkins rpm signing key.
rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
Install the Jenkins package.
We will be using version 2.19.4, which is the target version for the certification test.
yum install -y jenkins-2.19.4-1.1
Check for services running on 8080 before starting the Jenkins service.
netstat -tulpn | grep 8080
If nothing is running on 8080, go ahead and start the service via systemctl.
systemctl start jenkins
Also, enable the Jenkins service so it starts on system startup.
systemctl enable jenkins
Check again for services running on port 8080.
There will be a slight delay, so we’ll use watch to wait for the signal.
watch n=1 "netstat -tulpn | grep 8080"
Use Ctrl-C to break the watch when the service is shown to be running on 8080.
Visit the web GUI at:
http://your-server-fqdn:8080/
You’ll be prompted for the initialAdminPassword which is located in /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword on the system being configured. You’ll want to cat that and copy and paste it into the browser.
cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
Paste the password into Install Wizard.
Choose “Install Suggested Plugins.”
Set admin settings, user, password, etc.
Press “Enter.”
Click “Start Using Jenkins.”
Now you have your Jenkins Master up and running!
