Multi Region VPN Connection Using Strongswan

Connecting multiple regions together via a vpn connection using Strongswan.

You only need to run these commands on the right side of the VPN. This is the VPN you want your connection to go to.

Note: Make sure that the internal IP blocks are different on both regions. For example in this tutorial my us-east is running on 172.30.0.0/16 and my us-west is running on 172.31.0.0/16
